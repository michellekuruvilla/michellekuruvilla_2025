I learned about booleans and how they are a type of data type that have two outputs only, (true, false). I definetley recognized a lot of the weaknesses I had, and I got a lot wrong on the MC. Some examples of things I got wrong was ethical, and privacy concerns in coding, and what the missing code in the segnment is. I learned how to use loops to repeat code, and using conditional statements to make that happen. My strengths were in questons of the form of how we can move something into the grey box, using booleans, etc. \n",
