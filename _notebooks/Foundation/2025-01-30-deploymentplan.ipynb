    "- Computers have evolved over time, becoming smaller and more efficient while using routers and other devices for communication..\n",
    "- They \"talk\" to each other using number systems, breaking data into ones and zeros for transmission.\n",
    "- A packet is a group of numbers that carries information between devices.\n",
    "- A computer network is a collection of interconnected computing devices that can send and receive data.\n",
    "- Packet Switching: Messages (files) are divided into packets and sent in any order. The recipient's device reassembles them upon arrival.\n",
    "- A path between two computing devices consists of a sequence of directly connected devices, starting at the sender and ending at the receiver.\n",
    "- Routing is the process of determining the most efficient path for data to travel.\n",
    "- Computers rely on communication to streamline tasks, with packets facilitating the movement of information in bits.\n",

    "- Network Access Layer: Handles hardware-related connections, such as network cards or cables.\n",
    "- Internet Protocol (IP) Layer: Transfers data using packets containing metadata, including IP addresses, to direct information through routers.\n",
    "- Transport Layer: Uses TCP (which follows a strict three-way handshake) and UDP (a more relaxed protocol) to enforce rules for data transmission.\n",
    "- Application Layer: Runs programs on internet-connected devices and provides clients with webpages.\n",
