    "Blog: My Work on the Recommended Destinations Feature\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose of the Feature\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of my individual feature is to allow users to post recommended destinations for others to see. This creates a collaborative and interactive experience where users can share their favorite places and explore suggestions from others. It contributes to our group’s overall goal of building a platform that connects people through shared recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frontend Work\n",
    "\n",
    "In the frontend, I created a layout where users can type in a destination and post it. This form includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "A text input field for the destination name.\n",
    "\n",
    "A “Post” button to submit their recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design is clean and user-friendly, ensuring that users can easily add recommendations without confusion. Once submitted, the input data is sent to the backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backend Work\n",
    "\n",
    "In the backend, I implemented the following functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "API Endpoints: I created endpoints to handle user submissions. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A POST request to accept new recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A GET request to retrieve all submitted recommendations for display on the frontend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Database Integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations are stored in a database table, where each entry includes fields such as the destination name and a unique ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ensured proper database handling to avoid duplicate entries by checking for unique destination names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Added checks to validate user input and ensure that empty or invalid submissions are not stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built error responses to inform the frontend if something goes wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing and Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the feature works seamlessly:\n",
    "\n",
    "I tested API requests using Postman to confirm that the backend correctly receives and processes data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I collaborated with my team to integrate the feature into the group project.\n",
    "\n",
    "I verified that user-submitted destinations appear on the frontend after being processed by the backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaboration with My Group\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaboration was a key part of developing this feature. I worked closely with my team to ensure our features were aligned and compatible. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "I coordinated with the teammate handling the recommendations list display to ensure my API provided the necessary data in the correct format.\n",
    "\n",
    "We conducted group testing sessions to identify and resolve integration issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "During meetings, we discussed design choices and decided on a consistent style and functionality for our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "I supported teammates by reviewing their code and providing feedback, particularly on areas that overlapped with my feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Live Demo Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "During the review, I plan to demonstrate live interactions using the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the frontend to type a destination in the text input field and submit it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show how the recommendation is sent to the backend via a POST request and added to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refresh the page or retrieve data with a GET request to display the updated recommendations list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Postman to showcase raw API requests and responses, including error handling for invalid or duplicate submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "Database Queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "Used SQLAlchemy to query the database for existing destinations, add new entries, and retrieve all recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converted database rows into JSON format for the frontend to display.\n",
    "\n",
    "API Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "POST: Accepts data from the form and stores it in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "GET: Fetches all stored recommendations and sends them to the frontend in JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Response Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a user submits a duplicate destination, the API returns an error response indicating the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Example (Backend Method):\n",
    "\n",
    "class DestinationAPI:\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def post():\n",
    "        data = request.get_json()\n",
    "        name = data.get('name')\n",
    "        if not name:\n",
    "            return jsonify({\"error\": \"Destination name is required.\"}), 400\n",
    "\n",
    "        existing_destination = Destination.query.filter_by(name=name).first()\n",
    "        if existing_destination:\n",
    "            return jsonify({\"error\": \"Destination already exists.\"}), 409\n",
    "\n",
    "        new_destination = Destination(name=name)\n",
    "        db.session.add(new_destination)\n",
    "        db.session.commit()\n",
    "\n",
    "        return jsonify({\"message\": \"Destination added successfully!\"}), 201\n",
    "\n",
    "This method demonstrates sequencing (data validation and processing), selection (checking if a destination already exists), and iteration (if applicable when processing data in bulk).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward, I plan to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhance the frontend to display a confirmation message when a recommendation is successfully posted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Work with my team to refine the presentation of the recommendations list for better user engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement additional features like editing or deleting recommendations if time permits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature has been a rewarding project, as it showcases the power of collaboration and user interaction. By enabling users to share and discover destinations, it fulfills a key purpose of our website while integrating well with other features my team has developed.\n",
