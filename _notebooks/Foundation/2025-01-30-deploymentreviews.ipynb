    "Step 3: AWS EC2 Setup\n",
    "To host our application, we need to set up an EC2 instance on AWS. First, we log in to the AWS Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard. We select the instance that will host our application, ensuring it is properly configured to allow incoming traffic on port 8402. Security groups should be updated to permit HTTP and HTTPS requests. We also verify that our instance has Docker and Docker Compose installed to run the application containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Application Deployment Through VSCode\n",
    "Before deploying to AWS, we test our application locally. We check for an available port using docker ps and confirm that port 8402 is free. In the backend terminal, we run make to start the server and replace any references to localhost:8887 with http://127.0.0.1:8402. This ensures the frontend can correctly communicate with the backend through the new port.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Deployment in AWS EC2 Terminal\n",
    "Once the local test is successful, we move to deployment on AWS. We SSH into our EC2 instance and clone the project repository. Inside the project directory, we run docker-compose up -d --build to build and start the application in the background. To test the deployment, we replace localhost with our EC2 public IP and verify that the site is accessible on port 8402.\n",
    "Step 6: Route 53 and Nginx Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To map our domain to the EC2 instance, we create a new DNS record in AWS Route 53, pointing the subdomain to the public IP of our EC2 instance. Then, we configure Nginx as a reverse proxy to forward traffic to our application. We write a custom Nginx configuration file, update the proxy_pass to http://localhost:8402, and restart Nginx to apply the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 7: Certbot Certificate Setup\n",
    "To enable HTTPS, we use Certbot to generate an SSL certificate for our domain. Running sudo certbot --nginx, we automatically configure Nginx to serve the website over HTTPS. We also update the Nginx configuration to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS for security. After confirming the certificate installation, we restart Nginx to apply the changes.\n",
    "Step 8: Code Updates and Version Control\n",
    "Once deployment is complete, any necessary code changes must be carefully managed. We first run git pull to ensure we have the latest version of the code. Any changes are committed with meaningful messages, but commits should not be made directly from the AWS terminal. Locally, we test modifications by running docker-compose up and accessing http://127.0.0.1:8402 in a browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 9: Synchronizing AWS with Latest Changes\n",
    "To apply new updates in AWS, we SSH into the EC2 instance and navigate to the project directory. We first stop the running containers using docker-compose down, then pull the latest changes using git pull. After ensuring everything is up to date, we rebuild and restart the containers using docker-compose up -d --build.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 10: Final Testing and Debugging\n",
    "After deployment, we thoroughly test the website by checking different features and ensuring all API requests are functioning correctly. If any errors are found, we debug by inspecting logs with docker logs <container_id>. We also confirm that the HTTPS certificate is working, and the subdomain correctly routes to the EC2 instance. If needed, we update security group settings to allow incoming traffic. Once everything is verified, the deployment process is complete, and the site is live for users."
