    "Meaning of Negative Effects of Technology\n",
    "Negative effects of technology refer to the unintended harmful consequences that arise from technological advancements. These effects can include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Job displacement due to automation.\n",
    "Privacy violations through data collection and surveillance.\n",
    "Bias and discrimination in AI decision-making.\n",
    "Cybersecurity threats, such as hacking and data breaches.\n",
    "Mental health concerns, like addiction to social media and screen time overuse.\n",
    "How Responsible Programming Can Reduce These Impacts\n",
    "Responsible programming involves ethical coding practices that prioritize fairness, transparency, and security. Some ways to minimize negative effects include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias Detection and Fairness – Ensuring AI and machine learning models are trained on diverse, unbiased datasets to prevent discrimination.\n",
    "Data Privacy and Security – Implementing encryption, anonymization, and strict access controls to protect user data.\n",
    "Transparency and Explainability – Designing AI systems that provide clear explanations for their decisions, allowing users to understand and challenge outcomes.\n",
    "Human Oversight – Keeping humans in the loop for critical decision-making to prevent AI from making harmful autonomous choices.\n",
    "Cybersecurity Measures – Regularly testing and updating systems to defend against hacking and vulnerabilities.\n",
    "By following these principles, technology can be developed in a way that maximizes benefits while reducing unintended harm.\n",
