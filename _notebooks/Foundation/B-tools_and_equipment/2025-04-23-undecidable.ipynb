    "\n",
    "**Q:** Investigate and describe how modern operating systems and browsers handle infinite loops or excessively long-running scripts. What mechanisms are in place to detect and mitigate such issues? Provide real-world examples of these mechanisms in action, such as specific error messages, timeouts, or automated recovery processes.\n",

    "### üì± Operating Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern operating systems use several mechanisms to detect and manage infinite loops or excessively long-running processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CPU Scheduling and Time Slices:** Operating systems use preemptive multitasking, where each process is given a fixed \"time slice.\" If a process exceeds its allocated time or becomes unresponsive, it can be deprioritized or terminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task Manager / Activity Monitor:** Tools like Windows Task Manager or macOS Activity Monitor let users manually end unresponsive programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Watchdog Timers (System-Level):** Some systems use watchdog timers to detect hangs and restart services or the entire system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**üîß Real-World Example:**  \n",
    "On Windows, if a program becomes unresponsive due to an infinite loop, it will trigger the \"Not Responding\" label in the title bar. The user may be prompted to close the application manually.\n",

    "### üåê Web Browsers\n",
    "\n",
    "Browsers also have built-in protections to handle long-running or infinite JavaScript:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Script Timeouts:** Browsers monitor the execution time of scripts. If a script runs too long, it may prompt the user with a message like:\n",
    "  > \"A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Worker Threads:** Browsers can offload long-running code to Web Workers. If a worker becomes unresponsive, it can be terminated without freezing the main UI thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance Monitoring Tools:** DevTools in Chrome and Firefox include performance profilers to detect inefficient or looping code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**üîß Real-World Example:**  \n",
    "In Firefox, when a script takes too long to run, users may see:  \n",
    "> \"Warning: Unresponsive script ‚Äî A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chrome, long-running JavaScript can cause the browser tab to crash with an \"Aw, Snap!\" error.\n",

    "- **Edges (Links):** Represent relationships between those users (e.g., friendships, follows, messages).\n",

    "#### Types of Graphs in SNA:\n",
    "- **Directed Graphs:** Used when relationships have a direction (e.g., Twitter follows ‚Äî A follows B doesn‚Äôt mean B follows A).\n",
    "- **Undirected Graphs:** Used when relationships are mutual (e.g., Facebook friends ‚Äî both users have to accept the connection).\n",
    "- **Weighted Graphs:** Edges can have weights showing the strength of a relationship (e.g., number of messages exchanged).\n",
