        <h2>Define a Creative Commons License</h2>
        <p>A <strong>Creative Commons (CC) License</strong> is a public license that allows creators to share their work with specific permissions while still maintaining some rights. It provides a flexible way for authors, artists, and educators to grant permissions for use, modification, and distribution of their work.</p>

        <h3>Types of Creative Commons Licenses:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CC BY</strong> (Attribution) – Allows use and modifications as long as credit is given.</li>
            <li><strong>CC BY-SA</strong> (Attribution-ShareAlike) – Same as CC BY but requires derivatives to be shared under the same license.</li>
            <li><strong>CC BY-ND</strong> (Attribution-NoDerivatives) – Allows distribution but prohibits modifications.</li>
            <li><strong>CC BY-NC</strong> (Attribution-NonCommercial) – Allows non-commercial use only.</li>
            <li><strong>CC BY-NC-SA</strong> (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike) – Non-commercial use with required sharing under the same license.</li>
            <li><strong>CC BY-NC-ND</strong> (Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives) – The most restrictive; allows sharing only with attribution and no modifications or commercial use.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Exceptions to Copyright Law</h2>
        <p>Some uses of copyrighted material are legally <strong>exempt from copyright restrictions</strong>, allowing content to be used without permission under specific circumstances.</p>

        <h3>Common Copyright Exceptions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fair Use</strong> – Allows limited use for purposes such as education, news reporting, commentary, and research.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Domain</strong> – Works that are no longer under copyright protection or were never copyrighted.</li>
            <li><strong>First Sale Doctrine</strong> – Allows resale or lending of legally purchased copies (e.g., used books, DVDs).</li>
            <li><strong>Educational Use (TEACH Act)</strong> – Permits teachers and students to use copyrighted content in online learning environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Parody and Satire</strong> – Creative works that mimic or mock an original work for commentary or entertainment.</li>

        <div class="task">
            <h3>Task:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Research real-world examples of Creative Commons-licensed works.</li>
                <li>Find a case where Fair Use was successfully applied.</li>
                <li>Consider whether a Creative Commons license is appropriate for any of your own projects.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Task 1: Select a License</h2>
        <p>I have chosen the <strong>MIT License</strong> for my personal repository.</p>

        <h2>Task 2: Explain Your Choice</h2>
        <p>I selected the MIT License because it is a <strong>permissive</strong> license that allows others to freely use, modify, and distribute my project while only requiring attribution. This makes it ideal for open-source projects where I want to encourage collaboration without imposing strict conditions. The flexibility of the MIT License ensures that developers can integrate my code into both <strong>open-source and commercial</strong> projects without legal complexity. Additionally, by disclaiming warranties and liability, it protects me from any legal risks associated with how others use my code. Overall, this license balances <strong>openness and simplicity</strong>, making my project more accessible and widely adoptable.</p>
