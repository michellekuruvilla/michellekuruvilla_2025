        <h2>Unique Crowdsourcing Example: Galaxy Zoo</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Galaxy Zoo</span> is a remarkable crowdsourcing project where volunteers help classify galaxies based on telescope images.
            It launched in 2007 and harnesses the power of the public to analyze millions of celestial objects that would take astronomers years to process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Participants look at images of galaxies and identify their shapes, which helps researchers understand galaxy formation and the universe's structure.
            The project has led to numerous scientific discoveries, including new types of galaxies and rare cosmic phenomena.
        </p>
        <p>
            Galaxy Zoo proves that anyone, regardless of scientific background, can contribute to major astrophysical research.
