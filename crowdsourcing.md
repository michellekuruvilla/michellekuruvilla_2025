        <h2>Unique Crowdsourcing Example: Galaxy Zoo</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Galaxy Zoo</span> is a remarkable crowdsourcing project where volunteers help classify galaxies based on telescope images.
            It launched in 2007 and harnesses the power of the public to analyze millions of celestial objects that would take astronomers years to process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Participants look at images of galaxies and identify their shapes, which helps researchers understand galaxy formation and the universe's structure.
            The project has led to numerous scientific discoveries, including new types of galaxies and rare cosmic phenomena.
        </p>
        <p>
            Galaxy Zoo proves that anyone, regardless of scientific background, can contribute to major astrophysical research.

##How Crowdsourcing Improves Playlist Quality:
Diverse Music Selection – A wider range of contributors can introduce a variety of genres, artists, and hidden gems that a single curator might overlook.

Real-Time Updates – Playlists can stay fresh and up-to-date with trending or newly released songs that users collectively add.

Community-Driven Relevance – Crowdsourcing reflects the preferences of a larger audience, making the playlist more engaging and relatable.

Niche Playlists – Some niche playlists, like mood-based or hyper-specific themed lists, benefit from community contributions because they capture a broader interpretation of the theme.

## How Crowdsourcing Can Harm Playlist Quality:
Lack of Cohesion – Without strict guidelines, a playlist may become inconsistent in tone, genre, or style.

Overcrowding with Popular Songs – Crowdsourcing can lead to an overrepresentation of mainstream hits, drowning out lesser-known but high-quality tracks.

Low-Quality or Irrelevant Additions – If anyone can contribute, there’s a risk of inappropriate or low-quality songs being added.

Frequent Changes – Some playlists may lose their identity due to constant additions and removals, making it difficult to establish a consistent listening experience.

Balancing Crowdsourcing for Better Playlists:
Voting Mechanisms – Allowing users to upvote or downvote songs can help maintain quality.

Curatorial Oversight – Having a moderator or algorithm refine selections can ensure consistency.

Category-Specific Playlists – Setting clear guidelines for submissions (e.g., only lo-fi hip-hop for studying) can improve coherence.
