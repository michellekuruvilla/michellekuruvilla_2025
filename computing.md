  <h2>Popcorn Hack 2</h2>
  <p><strong>Which of the following is an example of symmetric encryption?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>A. Evy buys a locked box that operates using two different codes. When the first code is entered, a slot opens that allows a message to be put in the box. When the second code is entered, the door to the box opens. Evy gives the first code to her friends so they can leave messages for her and keeps the second code to herself so that she is the only one who can retrieve the messages.</li>
    <li>B. Finn and Gwen develop a system that maps each letter of the alphabet to a unique symbol using a secret key. Finn uses the key to write a message to Gwen where each letter is replaced with the corresponding symbol. Gwen uses the key to map each symbol back to the original letter.</li>
    <li>C. Hannah writes a message to send to Isabel and hides the message under a rock behind the soccer field. Hannah gives Isabel the exact location of the rock so that only Isabel can find the message.</li>
    <li>D. Juan writes a message to send to Kelly and slides the message through a slot in the front of Kellyâ€™s locker. Juan knows that Kelly has not shared her locker combination with anyone, so no one other than Kelly will be able to read the message.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>B, because Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. In this scenario, both Finn and Gwen use the same secret key to encode and decode messages, making it an example of symmetric encryption.</p>

  <h2>Last Popcorn Hack</h2>
  <p><strong>What makes a good password?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Length:</strong> The longer the password, the harder it is to crack. Aim for at least 12-16 characters.</li>
    <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> A mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters (e.g., @, #, $, %, etc.) adds layers of security.</li>
    <li><strong>Unpredictability:</strong> Avoid using easily guessable information like your name, birthdate, or common words. Passwords should be random or a combination of random words and characters.</li>
    <li><strong>No Repetitive or Sequential Characters:</strong> Avoid simple patterns like "123456," "password," or "qwerty."</li>
    <li><strong>Uniqueness:</strong> Use a different password for each account. If one account is compromised, it won't affect others.</li>
    <li><strong>Use of Passphrases:</strong> A passphrase (e.g., "BlueSky!37@Moon") is often easier to remember and still secure. It's a sequence of random words combined with symbols and numbers.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid Dictionary Words:</strong> Do not use words found in the dictionary alone, as these can be easily cracked using dictionary attacks.</li>
  </ul>
